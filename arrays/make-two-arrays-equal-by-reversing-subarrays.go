/*
  You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
  Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.

  Example:
    Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
    Output: true
    Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
    1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
    2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
    3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
    There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.
