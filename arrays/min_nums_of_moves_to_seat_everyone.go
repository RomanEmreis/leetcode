/*
  There are n seats and n students in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.
  You may perform the following move any number of times:
    Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
    Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

  Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

Example:
  Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]  
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
  - The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
  - The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
  - The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
  In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
